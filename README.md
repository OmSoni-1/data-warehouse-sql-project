# 🚀 Data Warehouse Project (Medallion Architecture)

This **portfolio project** showcases a **Data Warehouse** built using **SQL**, implementing **ETL processes, Data Modeling, and Analytics**. It follows the **Medallion Architecture** (🏅 **Bronze**, 🥈 **Silver**, 🥇 **Gold**) to ensure **structured, efficient, and scalable data management**.

## 🔹 Key Features  
- ✅ **ETL Pipelines** – Extract, Transform, Load for seamless data flow  
- ✅ **Data Modeling** – Optimized schema design for performance  
- ✅ **Analytics & Insights** – Querying and reporting for data-driven decisions  
- ✅ **Scalability & Efficiency** – Designed to handle large datasets  

This project is a **hands-on demonstration** of **Data Warehousing best practices**, structured for real-world applications! 🚀
